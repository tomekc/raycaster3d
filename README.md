When I was young, I had much more spare time to spend on hacking interesting projects. One thing that particularly was fascinating me was game development. I really wanted to develop my own 3D game engine, and I did have some successes.

Title of game is "Tajemnica Sryriusza" which is "Secret of Sirius" while word "Sirius" is deliberately misspelled. Did I say I was teenager when I wrote this?

## Technical specs
* Raycasting 3D engine (like the one in [Wolfenstein-3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) game). 
* This code was born during golden age of DOS, and was compiled under DJGPP (DOS port of GNU C). 
* I used [Allegro](http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/) game library.
* *Compiled binary is included.* You should be able to run it under [DosBox](http://www.dosbox.org).

## Beware of:
* Comments are in Polish :-)
* Code has been written by teenager :-)
